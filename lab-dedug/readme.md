### QuickSort Algorithm: Theoretical Overview

QuickSort is an efficient sorting algorithm based on the "divide-and-conquer" paradigm. It works by selecting a pivot and partitioning the array such that:

- Elements smaller than the pivot are placed on the left.
- Elements greater than the pivot are placed on the right.

QuickSort is then recursively applied to the left and right subarrays.

---

#### Theoretical Steps:
1. **Choose a pivot**: Typically the first element, the last element, or a random element.
2. **Partition the array**:
   - Place elements smaller than the pivot on the left.
   - Place elements greater than the pivot on the right.
3. **Recursion**:
   - Apply QuickSort to the left and right subarrays until each subarray contains only one element.

---

#### Example:
For the array `[3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]`:

1. **Pivot**: `3`
2. **Partition**:
   - Left: `[1, 2, 1]`
   - Pivot: `[3]`
   - Right: `[6, 8, 10]`
3. **Recursion**:
   - Left: `[1, 1, 2]`
   - Right: `[6, 8, 10]`
4. **Final Result**: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]`

### Exercise: QuickSort with a Subtle Error

#### Context
You need to implement the QuickSort algorithm. However, the provided code contains a hidden error that leads to unexpected behavior. Your task is to:

1. Identify and understand the error.
2. Correct it using the integrated debugger in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

---

#### Faulty Code:
```php
<?php
function quickSort($arr) {
    if (count($arr) <= 1) {
        return $arr;
    }

    $pivot = $arr[0];
    $left = [];
    $right = [];

    foreach ($arr as $key => $value) {
        if ($key === 0) continue; 
        if ($value < $pivot) {
            $left[] = $value;
        } else {
            $right[] = $value;
        }
    }

    return array_merge(quickSort($left), [$pivot], quickSort($right));
}

// Test the algorithm
$array = [5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 5];
$sorted = quickSort($array);

echo "Sorted array: " . implode(", ", $sorted);
?>
```

#### Debugging Steps in VSCode:
1. **Configure VSCode for PHP Debugging**:
   - Install the **PHP Debug** extension.
   - Edit `php.ini` to enable Xdebug:
     ```ini
     xdebug.mode = debug
     xdebug.start_with_request = yes
     ```
   - Create a `launch.json` file in VSCode:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
           "type": "php",
           "request": "launch",
           "port": 9003
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Set Breakpoints**:
   - Place a breakpoint in the `foreach` loop and before the `return` statement.

3. **Run the Debugger**:
   - Launch the script and inspect the values of `$left`, `$right`, and `$pivot` in each recursive call.

---

#### Diagnosing the Error:
- The issue lies in how elements equal to the pivot are handled. They are added to `$right`, leading to incorrect sorting when duplicate elements exist.

---

#### Expected Outcome:
For the input `[5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 5]`, the expected sorted array is:

```
Sorted array: 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 8
```

---

### Conclusion:

1. **Why was this error subtle?**
   - The algorithm worked correctly for arrays without duplicates but failed in specific cases involving values equal to the pivot.

2. **Importance of VSCode Debugging**:
   - The debugger allowed step-by-step inspection of variable values, making it easier to pinpoint the issue in the partition logic.

3. **Overall Benefit**:
   - This exercise demonstrates the value of modern tools like VSCode's debugger in diagnosing and resolving errors in complex algorithms effectively.
